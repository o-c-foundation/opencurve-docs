# Creating Your First Token on OpenCurve

This guide walks you through the process of creating and launching your own token on the OpenCurve platform.

## Prerequisites

Before creating a token, ensure you have:

- A Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.) connected to OpenCurve
- Sufficient ETH or SEPL (depending on the network) for gas fees
- A clear vision for your token's purpose and utility

## Token Creation Process

### Step 1: Access the Launch Page

Navigate to the [Launch Token](https://opencurve.fun/launch) page from the main OpenCurve interface.

### Step 2: Configure Token Parameters

Fill in the following details for your token:

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Token Name | The full name of your token (e.g., "OpenCurve Token") |
| Token Symbol | A short identifier for your token (e.g., "OCT") |
| Initial Supply | Maximum token supply (capped at 1 billion) |
| Logo | Upload an image for your token (recommended size: 200x200px) |
| Description | A brief description of your token's purpose and utility |

### Step 3: Configure AI Agent (Optional)

You can connect your token to an AI agent that provides utility and services. This step is optional but recommended to add immediate utility to your token.

- **Agent Name**: Name for your AI agent
- **Agent Description**: What services your agent will provide
- **Agent Capabilities**: Select from available tools and capabilities

### Step 4: Review and Deploy

Review all the information you've provided and click "Deploy Token" to launch your token. The deployment process includes:

1. Creating the token smart contract
2. Locking initial liquidity
3. Setting up trading pairs
4. Configuring agent connection (if selected)

### Step 5: Confirmation

Once your token is deployed, you'll receive a confirmation with:

- Token contract address
- Trading pair details
- Agent connection status
- Next steps for promoting your token

## Token Economics

Tokens created on OpenCurve follow these principles:

- **Maximum Supply**: Up to 1 billion tokens
- **Ownership**: Contract ownership is renounced after creation
- **Liquidity**: Initial liquidity is locked forever
- **Fees**: Standard trading fees (0.3% per transaction)

## Adding Utility to Your Token

To maximize the value and adoption of your token, consider these strategies:

1. **Agent Integration**: Configure your AI agent to provide valuable services
2. **Community Building**: Engage with holders through the integrated chat
3. **Partnerships**: Collaborate with other projects in the OpenCurve ecosystem
4. **Marketing**: Promote your token through social media and crypto communities

## Managing Your Token

After creation, you can manage various aspects of your token through the dashboard:

- Monitor trading activity and price
- View holder statistics
- Manage agent settings and capabilities
- Engage with your community
